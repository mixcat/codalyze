Compile with

make console

to get the console version. Default

make

will produce a version with no output ready to be flashed (more or less). You
need avr-gcc and a bunch of stuff. So far it works on a Mac OSX with avr-gcc,
avr-libc etc installed via mac ports.

Run it with 

./evo_console data $RANDOM

where $RANDOM is the usual BASH random variable (it's used to initialize the
random number generator). It will produce a file named

out

which contains a diff of the changes in the sudoku; first byte is position (from
1 to 81), second byte is the digit (from 0 to 9, where 0 is 'black' or empty
  square). Feed it through a serial connection to the Arduino board or through a
  pipe to a blinkm simulator (to be released some time soon between here and
  infinity).

The file named

data 

is the file containing the sudoku. When ran in non-console mode it has a default sudoku inside (see source code for that). The file format is whatever you want, just use non-digit values for spaces in the sudoku and digits for the rest.

Usual disclaimer apply (no liability, do whatever you want with it, etc). 

Code is released with GNU GPL. The Makefile has been hacked together by
incorporating an Eclipse-generated makefile, which in turn has been
probably inspired/taken from the Arduino/blinkm/avr-gcc makefiles.

thanks to Kate F. for trying to teach me how to code in standard C. 

This is the ugliest README I've ever seen in my life. And the code is full of
#ifdef. I will fix them.
