		<h1>Flickaway: a flickr viewer</h1>
		
		<p>
			Motivation: even if I like <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a>, sometimes I'd like to have a simpler space for my pictures.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wrote this little javascript program to display my pictures in a standalone html page.
			<ul>Features:
				<li>It's javascript-only, no server code is required.</li>
				<li>Images are pulled straight away from flickr, no storage is required.</li>
				<li>Supports bookmarking</li>
				<li>Supports history: you can use back/forward buttons</li>
				<li>All code is open source</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Try the <a href="matteo.html">DEMO</a> (my pictures). If you like it, you can...
		</p>
		
		<h2>Install it on your web server (with your pictures, not mine)</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>You only need to download one html file and publish it somewhere in your website</li>
				<li>It will always be up-to-date: the html file is 'almost empty' and loads the required javascript and styles from the net.
					As I add fetaures and fix bugs, you'll always have the latest release.</li>
				<li>It's skinnable, so you can style it to match your taste.</li>
			</ul>
			Use the <a href="setup.html">Setup wizard</a> to get started.
