Hi Matteo,

I2C is an asymmetric protocol: a typical bus has one I2C master and one or more I2C slave. The Arduino Wire library is how to do an I2C master. You need code on how to make an I2C slave.

Atmel provides a pretty good application note in "AVR312: Using the USI module as a I2C slave". Scroll down to download it here:

It's interesting if you want to know some of the theory behind how it works.

For more immediate results, you can find examples of people using this application note 
with avr-gcc on the net. One of the best examples is d.tools, http://hci.stanford.edu/research/dtools/ and you can look at the source code to many different kinds of I2C 
slaves they've implemented here:
http://d-tools.cvs.sourceforge.net/d-tools/dtools-avr-code/attiny45-slaves/

I think the d.tools examples are using the IAR compiler instead of the AVR-GCC compiler. There's no real difference, just slight syntax changes for a few things. To see an avr-gcc examples, poke around on avrfreaks.net. There's a few projects and forum posts that port AVR312 appnote. For example, here's one: http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?module=Freaks%20Academy&func=viewItem&item_id=425&item_type=project

- Timing. You need to have some sort of external sync pulse to keep BlinkMs synchronized.  They would need big external crystals to have better timing accuracy than they have now.  One way of creating an external sync pulse is to toggle all the BlinkM's reset pin at once. Similarly, toggle all their power lines.

- Reliance:  Send me any bad BlinkMs and I'll mail you replacements. Apologies that you got bad ones.  We test each one before it ships, but once in a while one fails afterwards.

- Distance:  Are you using external pullup resistors on SDA & SCL for  your master?  That will help with distance.  You can also clock the I2C master slower, I can give you some tips on how to do that if the pullup resistors don't work.  I am very curious to hear how the NXP I2C buffer chips work out if you end up using them.

- Firmware:  We can't release the BlinkM firmware source code due to some licensing agreements we signed with Philips/NXP.  However, from my "smart led prototypes" and the I2C slave code I mention in the GetSatisfaction post, you have pretty much all the component parts of  BlinkM code.
