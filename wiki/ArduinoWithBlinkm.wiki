#summary Arduino and blinkm software and hardware
= Introduction =

Arduino is used to drive an array of blinkms


= Details =

Blinkms are smart components attached to an I2C bus,
which has a limited maximum length (tops few meters, no more than one in my first installment).

The 100 blinkms will be spaced somewhere between 4 and 10 cm: a gross bus length
estimate is 4/10m, well beyond I2C max length.

To overcome this, I'm trying out some I2C bus extender chips, made by NXP, which should allow up to 50m.
