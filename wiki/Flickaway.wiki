#summary [Draft] Client-only flickr viewer

= Introduction =

One simple html page with very limited content:

  * remote library: jquery (google javascript libraries apis)
  * remote script: loader.js?iv=<initial_version>
  * remote css: reset and base from yui
  * skin name: class name of body element
  * page title
  * remote anchors to flickr feeds (full feed urls)

Loader.js?iv=<initial_version>

  * small and short-cached (~weeks)
  * *iv* is a numeric value that describes on which version this page was generated.
  * loader will always load the best version compatible with iv
  * loader detects the configured skin and loads the best css compatible with iv

Css

  * css skin files are versioned and configured as never-expire
