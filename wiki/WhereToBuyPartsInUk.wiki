== General Electronics ==

  * [http://uk.digikey.com Digikey Corporation] Huge catalog from chips to tools, crappy online shopping system. No retail shops
  * [http://uk.farnell.com Farnell UK] Has most of required stuff in stock. Good shopping online, same day delivery for free]. No retail shop, pheraps a counter for pick up.
  * [http://www.maplin.co.uk Maplin Electronics] Partly a generic consumer shop, also has some low level components. Many retails stores around london, and you can check stock availability on the web site before even gettin into the tube.
  * [http://uk.rs-online.com] Catalog seems good, as does the web site. Never ordered from this people.

== Arduino, prototyping, etc ==

[http://tinker.it Tinker.it] All arduino-related stuff, some very neat sensors, thingm and sparkfun components. Never ordered from.
