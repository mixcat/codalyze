## General Electronics ##

  * [Digikey Corporation](http://uk.digikey.com) Huge catalog from chips to tools, crappy online shopping system. No retail shops
  * [Farnell UK](http://uk.farnell.com) Has most of required stuff in stock. Good shopping online, same day delivery for free]. No retail shop, pheraps a counter for pick up.
  * [Maplin Electronics](http://www.maplin.co.uk) Partly a generic consumer shop, also has some low level components. Many retails stores around london, and you can check stock availability on the web site before even gettin into the tube.
  * http://uk.rs-online.com Catalog seems good, as does the web site. Never ordered from this people.

## Arduino, prototyping, etc ##

[Tinker.it](http://tinker.it) All arduino-related stuff, some very neat sensors, thingm and sparkfun components. Never ordered from.
